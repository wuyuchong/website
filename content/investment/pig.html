<h1>Domestic and Foreign Hog Prices</h1>
<div id="domestic-hog-price" class="section level2">
<h2>Domestic Hog Price</h2>
<p>Domestic hog prices have continued to rise, with an increase of 6.22% in the recent 60 days. The reason is mainly affected by the swine epidemic and the new coronavirus. The impact of swine on small and medium-sized pig farms, especially on private self-employed, is huge, and the suspension of operations caused by the new coronavirus made it more difficult for large non-professional pig companies to withstand huge losses. This has also accelerated the specialization of the hog slaughtering industry.</p>
<p>As far as supervision is concerned, the hygiene standards for hog slaughtering will be further improved and enforcement will be strengthened. In the future of professionalization and scale industry, the proportion of individual hog breeders will be further reduced.</p>

<h2>Hog import</h2>
<p>According to the data of an international website <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> , the current Chinese pork price is 35.69 CNY / kg, while the US is 45.19 USD / cwt. After conversion, the American pig price is: (CNY / kg)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>45.19 / 45.359237 * 6.9724</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6.946386</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>(35.69-6.946386) / 6.946386</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4.137924</code></pre>
<p>The difference is about four times as large.</p>
<p>And in the recent Sino-US agreement, tariffs on pork have been reduced since January 1. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>According to data from Yahoo Finance <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> , the current price of hogs futures due on April 20th in the international market has fallen sharply, showing that the price of hogs in the next two months is likely to continue to decline.</p>
<p>However, not all pork suppliers are eligible for pork imports, the regulatory authorities have very few quotas for pork imports. And in fact, only a few companies are allowed to import.</p>
