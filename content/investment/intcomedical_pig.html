<h1>Intco-Medical</h1>
<p>Although the official data of confirmed cases nationwide is still climbing, and there is no sign of improvement in other news channels. However, the price of stocks in the medical and health sector has experienced a sharper decline after the previous trading day, and Inco Medical has fallen accordingly. After all, equity trading is based on the present but future-oriented, and the current valuation of medical and health stocks is already relatively high. It is not surprising that stock prices have fallen in the face of medical resource shortages.</p>
<p>In the short term when affected by the outbreak, we have no way of knowing whether the peak of the medical sector has passed. Although we are optimistic toward Intco-Medical in the long term, it may still be to comply with the capital market and invest when its valuation is low.</p>
<p>Based on this, we decided to sell ** Intco-Medical ** at a reasonable price based on technical analysis today (2020-02-10).</p>
<p>This long-position trade has an average buying price of 25.75 CNY and an average selling price of 26.08 CNY. The yield is 1.28%.</p>
